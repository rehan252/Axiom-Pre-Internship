Problem 1: You are given a list called my_list. Using this list, you must create a tuple called
 my_tuple. The tuple will contain the listâ€™s first element, last element, and the length of the list,
in that same order. Sample Input #
my_list = [34, 82.6, "Darth Vader", 17, "Hannibal"]

Problem 2 - Kth Maximum Integer in a List: Given a list of integers and a number k, find the kth maximum element

Problem 3 - Highs and Lows: You must implement the count_low_high() function. 
Its parameter is a list of numbers. If a number is greater than 50 or divisible 
by 3, it will count as a high. If these conditions are not met, the number is considered a low.
At the end of the function, you must return a list that contains the number of lows and highs, 
in that order. In case the list is empty, you may return None.
Sample Input #
num_list = [20, 9, 51, 81, 50, 42, 77]
