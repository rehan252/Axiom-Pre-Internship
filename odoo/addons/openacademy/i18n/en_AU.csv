Odoo modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the 
reasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization 
leaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies 
fund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers,

2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't

EU Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) VAT for telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services
=============================================================================================

As of January 1rst, 2015, telecommunications, broadcasting
and electronic services sold within the European Union
have to be always taxed in the country where the customer
belongs. In order to simplify the application of this EU
directive, the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) registration scheme
allows businesses to make a unique tax declaration.

This module makes it possible by helping with the creation
of the required EU fiscal positions and taxes in order to
automatically apply and record the required taxes.

This module installs a wizard to help setup fiscal positions
and taxes for selling electronic services inside EU.

The wizard lets you select:
 - the EU countries to which you are selling these
   services
 - your national VAT tax for services, to be mapped
   to the target country's tax
 - optionally: a template fiscal position, in order
   to copy the account mapping. Should be your
   existing B2C Intra-EU fiscal position. (defaults
   to no account mapping)
 - optionally: an account to use for collecting the
   tax amounts (defaults to the account used by your
   national VAT tax for services)

It creates the corresponding fiscal positions and taxes,
automatically applicable for EU sales with a customer
in the selected countries.
The wizard can be run again for adding more countries.

The wizard creates a separate Chart of Taxes for collecting the
VAT amounts of the MOSS declaration, so extracting the MOSS
data should be easy.
Look for a Chart of Taxes named ""EU MOSS VAT Chart"" in the
Taxes Report menu (Generic Accounting Report).

Encrypted passwords
===================

Replaces the default password storage with a strong cryptographic
hash.

The key derivation function currently used is RSA Security LLC's
industry-standard ``PKDF2``, in combination with ``SHA512``.
This includes salting and key stretching with several thousands
rounds.

All passwords are encrypted as soon as the module is installed.
This may take a few minutes if there are thousands of users.

Past versions of encrypted passwords will be automatically upgraded
to the current scheme whenever a user authenticates
(``auth_crypt`` was previously using the weaker ``md5crypt`` key
derivation function).

Note: Installing this module permanently prevents user password
recovery and cannot be undone. It is thus recommended to enable
some password reset mechanism for users, such as the one provided
by the ``auth_signup`` module (signup for new users does not
necessarily have to be enabled).

New extensible file import for Odoo
======================================

Re-implement Odoo's file import system:

* Server side, the previous system forces most of the logic into the
  client which duplicates the effort (between clients), makes the
  import system much harder to use without a client (direct RPC or
  other forms of automation) and makes knowledge about the
  import/export system much harder to gather as it is spread over
  3+ different projects.

* In a more extensible manner, so users and partners can build their
  own front-end to import from other file formats (e.g. OpenDocument
  files) which may be simpler to handle in their work flow or from
  their data production sources.

An ISR will be generated if you specify the information it needs :

    - Your invoice must have been set assigned a bank account to receive its payment
      (this can be done manually, but a default value is automatically set if you have defined a bank account).
    - You must have set the postal references of your bank.
    - Your invoice must be in EUR or CHF (as ISRs do not accept other currencies)

The generation of the ISR is automatic if you meet the previous criteria.

Here is how it works:
    - Printing the invoice will trigger the download of two files: the invoice, and its ISR
    - Clicking the 'Send by mail' button will attach two files to your draft mail : the invoice, and the corresponding ISR.

Fiscal positions
----------------

When considering taxes to be applied, it is the province where the delivery occurs that matters.
Therefore we decided to implement the most common case in the fiscal positions: delivery is the
responsibility of the vendor and done at the customer location.

Some examples:

1) You have a customer from another province and you deliver to his location.
On the customer, set the fiscal position to his province.

2) You have a customer from another province. However this customer comes to your location
with their truck to pick up products. On the customer, do not set any fiscal position.

3) An international vendor doesn't charge you any tax. Taxes are charged at customs
by the customs broker. On the vendor, set the fiscal position to International.

4) An international vendor charge you your provincial tax. They are registered with your
position.

This module applies to companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to
companies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte).

This localisation module creates the VAT taxes of type 'tax included' for purchases
(it is notably required when you use the module 'hr_expense'). Beware that these
'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this
module (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'
scenarios in fiscal positions).

This localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland
company sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the
fiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes
and 'service' VAT taxes. We consider that it is too 'heavy' to have this by default
in l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the
configuration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.

Upon confirmation of a sales order or when quantities are added,
the picking that reserves from stock will be reserved if the
necessary quantities are available.

In the simplest configurations, this is an easy way of working:
first come, first served.  However, when not installed, you can
use manual reservation or run the schedulers where the system
will take into account the expected date and the priority.

If this automatic reservation would reserve too much, you can
still unreserve a picking.

VAT validation for Partner's VAT numbers.
=========================================

After installing this module, values entered in the VAT field of Partners will
be validated for all supported countries. The country is inferred from the
2-letter country code that prefixes the VAT number, e.g. ``BE0477472701``
will be validated using the Belgian rules.

There are two different levels of VAT number validation:
--------------------------------------------------------
    * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation
      rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and 
      always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,
      or not valid anymore.

    * When the ""VAT VIES Check"" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's
      Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES
      database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently
      allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple
      off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available
      all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the
      requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed
      instead.

Supported countries currently include EU countries, and a few non-EU countries
such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway or Russia. For unsupported countries,
only the country code will be validated.

Barcodes module documentation
==============================

This module brings barcode encoding logic and client-side barcode scanning utilities.


Barcodes encoding
==============================

The Barcodes module defines barcode nomenclatures whose rules identify specific type 
of items e.g. products, locations. It contains the following features:

- Patterns to identify barcodes containing a numerical value (e.g. weight, price)
- Definitin of barcode aliases that allow to identify the same product with different barcodes
- Unlimited barcode patterns and definitions,
- Support for encodings EAN-13, EAN-8 and UPC-A

Barcode encodings
-----------------

A barcode is an arbitrary long sequence of ASCII characters. An EAN-13 barcode is a 13 digit
barcode, whose 13th digit is the checksum. 

Simple barcodes and rules
-------------------------

The default nomenclature assumes an EAN-13 encoding for product barcodes. It defines a rule 
for Unit Products whose encoding is EAN-13, and whose pattern is '.', i.e. any barcode 
matches this pattern. Scanning the barcode of a product, say '5410013101703', matches this rule. 
The scanned item is thus identified as a Unit Product, and is retrieved from the product table.

Note: the special character '.' in patterns is matched by any character. To explicitely specify 
the '.' character in a pattern, escape it with '\'. The '\' character has to be escaped as well
('\\') to be explicitely specified.

Let us now suppose that we identify other items with barcodes, say stock locations. We define a
new rule in the nomenclature with the corresponding type (in our example, the type is 'Location'),
and whose pattern is e.g. '414.', that is, any location barcode starts with '414'. Scanning a barcode
location, say '41401', matches this Location rule, and the corresponding location is retrieved from
the location table.

Note: Rules have a sequence field which indicates the order the rules are evaluated (ASC). In our 
previous examples, the Unit Product rule should have a larger sequence that then Location rule, 
because we want the latter one to be evaluated first.

Barcodes with numerical content
--------------------------------

Barcodes may encode numerical content, which is decoded by the barcodes module. To that purpose,
one have to define a new rule for barcodes with numerical content (e.g. barcodes for Weighted 
Products). The numerical content in a pattern is specified between braces (special characters '{' and 
'}'). The content of the braces must be a sequence of 'N's (representing the whole part of the numerical 
content) followed by a sequence of 'D's (representing the decimal part of the numerical content). 
For instance, let us define a new rule for Weighted Products whose pattern is '21.....{NNDDD}.'. Since
we assume EAN-13 encoding for product barcodes, the encoding of this rule should be EAN-13 as well.

Let us now assume that we want to write a barcode for a given Weighted Product, say oranges. We first 
have to define in product oranges a barcode that will match the Weighted Product rule. This barcode 
must start with '21' and be a correct EAN-13 barcode (i.e. the 13th digit must be a correct checksum). 
Moreover, all the numerical content must be set to a '0'. For instance, let us set the barcode to 
'2100001000004'. 

We now want to write a barcode for 2.75kg of oranges. This barcode should be '2100001027506' (the 
numerical content of this barcode is '02750', and the correct checksum is '6'). When scanned, this 
barcode matches the Weighted Product rule (since is starts with '21'). The numerical content is extracted, 
and replaced by a sequence of '0's. The correct checksum is then computed for the obtained barcode 
('2100001000004') and the corresponding product (oranges) is retrieved from product table.

Note: the special characters '{' and '}' in patterns are used to identify numerical content. To 
explicitely specify '{' or '}' in a pattern, they must be escaped.


Strict EAN-13 field of barcode nomenclatures
--------------------------------------------

Many barcode scanners strip the leading zero when scanning EAN-13 barcodes. Barcode nomenclatures
have a boolean field ""Use strict EAN13"". If False, when trying to match a scanned barcode with
a rule whose encoding is EAN-13, if the barcode is of length 12 and, by prepending it by a 0,
the last digit is the correct checksum, we automatically prepend the barcode by 0 and try to
find a match with this new barcode. If ""Use strict EAN13"" is set to True, we look for a pattern
matching the original, 12-digit long, barcode.



Barcodes scanning
==============================

Scanning
--------

Use a USB scanner (that mimics keyboard inputs) in order to work with barcodes in Odoo.
The scanner must be configured to use no prefix and a carriage return or tab as suffix.
The delay between each character input must be less than or equal to 50 milliseconds.
Most barcode scanners will work out of the box.
However, make sure the scanner uses the same keyboard layout as the device it's plugged in.
Either by setting the device's keyboard layout to US QWERTY (default value for most readers)
or by changing the scanner's keyboard layout (check the manual).


Barcode events
------------------------------

When the module barcodes is installed, it instanciate a singleton of the javascript class BarcodeEvents.
The purpose of this component is to listen to keypresses to detect barcodes, then dispatch those barcodes
on core.bus inside a 'barcode_event'.
All keypress events are buffered until there is no more keypress during 50ms or a carriage return / tab is
inputted (because most barcode scanners use this as a suffix).
If the buffered keys looks like a barcode, an event is triggered :
core.bus.trigger('barcode_scanned', barcode);
Otherwise, the keypresses are 'resent'. However, for security reasons, a keypress event programmatically
crafted doesn't trigger native browser behaviors. For this reason, BarcodeEvents doesn't intercept keypresses
whose target is an editable element (eg. input) or when ctrl/cmd/alt is pushed.
To catch keypresses targetting an editable element, it must have the attribute barcode_events=""true"".


Barcode handlers
------------------------------

To keep the web client consistent, components that want to listen to barcode events should include BarcodeHandlerMixin.
It requires method on_barcode_scanned(barcode) to be implemented and exposes methods start_listening and stop_listening
As long as it is the descendant of a View managed by a ViewManager is only listens while the view is attached.


Form view barcode handler
------------------------------

It is possible for a form view to listen to barcode events, handle them client side and/or server-side.
When the barcode is handled server-side, it works like an onchange. The relevant model must include the
BarcodeEventsMixin and redefine method on_barcode_scanned. This method receives the barcode scanned and
the `self` is a pseudo-record representing the content of the form view, just like in @api.onchange methods.
Barcodes prefixed with 'O-CMD' or 'O-BTN' are reserved for special features and are never passed to on_barcode_scanned.
The form view barcode handler can be extended to add client-side handling. Please refer to the (hopefully
well enough) documented file for more informations.


Button barcode handler
------------------------------

Add an attribute 'barcode_trigger' to a button to be able to trigger it by scanning a barcode. Example :
<button name=""validate"" type=""object"" barcode_trigger=""validate""/> will be triggered when a barcode containing
""O-BTN.validate"" is scanned.

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_auth_ldap,"Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.
===============================================
This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and
will automatically create Odoo users for them on the fly.

**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module installed.

Configuration:
--------------
After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the
General Settings menu. Different companies may have different
LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique
in Odoo, even across multiple companies).

Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by
simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.
This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master
LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to
authenticate it.

Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting
it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.

For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf
manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.

Security Considerations:
------------------------
Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the LDAP server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the
password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.

Odoo does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).

It is also possible to have local Odoo users in the database along with
LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).

Here is how it works:
---------------------
    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local Odoo
      database;
    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local
      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;

As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local Odoo database
(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is
queried to do the authentication.

Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is
encrypted.

User Template:
--------------
In the LDAP configuration on the General Settings, it is possible to select a *User
Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users
whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This
allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.

**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be
         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting
         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You
         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to
         login once with a valid LDAP user, let Odoo create a blank local
         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new
         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups

==================================================

Ce module permet de générer le fichier FEC tel que définit par `l'arrêté du 29
Juillet 2013 <http://legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2013/7/29/BUDE1315492A/jo/texte>`
portant modification des dispositions de l'article A. 47 A-1 du
livre des procédures fiscales.

Cet arrêté prévoit l'obligation pour les sociétés ayant une comptabilité
informatisée de pouvoir fournir à l'administration fiscale un fichier
regroupant l'ensemble des écritures comptables de l'exercice. Le format de ce
fichier, appelé *FEC*, est définit dans l'arrêté.

Le détail du format du FEC est spécifié dans le bulletin officiel des finances publiques `BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213 <http://bofip.impots.gouv.fr/bofip/ext/pdf/createPdfWithAnnexePermalien/BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213.pdf?doc=9028-PGP&identifiant=BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213>` du 13 Décembre 2013. Ce module implémente le fichier
FEC au format texte et non au format XML, car le format texte sera facilement
lisible et vérifiable par le comptable en utilisant un tableur.

La structure du fichier FEC généré par ce module a été vérifiée avec le logiciel
*Test Compta Demat* version 1_00_05 disponible sur
`le site de la direction générale des finances publiques <http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgfip/outil-test-des-fichiers-des-ecritures-comptables-fec>`
en utilisant une base de donnée Odoo réelle.

","Fichier d'Échange Informatisé (FEC) pour la France
==================================================

Ce module permet de générer le fichier FEC tel que définit par `l'arrêté du 29
Juillet 2013 <http://legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2013/7/29/BUDE1315492A/jo/texte>`
portant modification des dispositions de l'article A. 47 A-1 du
livre des procédures fiscales.

Cet arrêté prévoit l'obligation pour les sociétés ayant une comptabilité
informatisée de pouvoir fournir à l'administration fiscale un fichier
regroupant l'ensemble des écritures comptables de l'exercice. Le format de ce
fichier, appelé *FEC*, est définit dans l'arrêté.

Le détail du format du FEC est spécifié dans le bulletin officiel des finances publiques `BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213 <http://bofip.impots.gouv.fr/bofip/ext/pdf/createPdfWithAnnexePermalien/BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213.pdf?doc=9028-PGP&identifiant=BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213>` du 13 Décembre 2013. Ce module implémente le fichier
FEC au format texte et non au format XML, car le format texte sera facilement
lisible et vérifiable par le comptable en utilisant un tableur.

La structure du fichier FEC généré par ce module a été vérifiée avec le logiciel
*Test Compta Demat* version 1_00_05 disponible sur
`le site de la direction générale des finances publiques <http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgfip/outil-test-des-fichiers-des-ecritures-comptables-fec>`
en utilisant une base de donnée Odoo réelle.

Configuration
=============

Aucune configuration n'est nécessaire.

Utilisation
===========

Pour générer le *FEC*, allez dans le menu *Accounting > Reporting > French Statements > FEC* qui va démarrer l'assistant de génération du FEC.

------------------

### Infinitely flexible. Incredibly easy to use.


Odoo's collaborative and realtime <a href=""https://www.odoo.com/page/project-management"">open source project management</a>
helps your team get work done. Keep track of everything, from the big picture
to the minute details, from the customer contract to the billing.

Designed to fit your own process
--------------------------------

Organize projects around your own processes. Work on tasks and issues using the
kanban view, schedule tasks using the gantt chart and control deadlines in the
calendar view. Every project may have it's own stages allowing teams to
optimize their job.

Easy to use
-----------

Get organized as fast as you can think. The easy-to-use interface takes no time
to learn, and every action is instantaneous, so there’s nothing standing
between you and your sweet productive flow.

Work Together
-------------

### Real time chats, document sharing, email integration

Use open chatter to communicate with your team or customers and share comments
and documents on tasks and issues. Integrate discussion fast with the email
integration.

Talk to others users or customers with the website live chat feature.

Collaborative Writing
---------------------

### The power of etherpad, inside your tasks

Collaboratively edit the same specifications or meeting minutes right inside
the application. The incorporated etherpad feature allows several people to
work on the same tasks, at the same time.

This is very efficient for scrum meetings, meeting minutes or complex
specifications. Every user has their own color and you can replay the whole
creation of the content.

Get Work Done
-------------

Get alerts on followed events to stay up to date with what interests you. Use
instant green/red visual indicators to scan through what has been done and what
requires your attention.

Timesheets, Contracts & Invoicing
---------------------------------

Projects are automatically integrated with customer contracts allowing you to
invoice based on time & materials and record timesheets easily.

Track Issues
------------

Single out the issues that arise in a project in order to have a better focus
on resolving them. Integrate customer interaction on every issue and get
accurate reports on your team's performance.
